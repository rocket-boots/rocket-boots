# RocketBoots Web Game Kit

RocketBoots is an open source kit to help create web games in JavaScript and HTML5.

# How do I use this kit?

There aren't detailed instructions yet, but if you're interested you can look through some of my game's code at https://github.com/deathraygames ... Most games in the last few years use RocketBoots in one way or another. 

# What's included in this repo?

At the root you'll find:

* `README.md`, `LICENSE`, etc.
* `scripts` directory
  * `libs` directory - contains various open source libraries that RocketBoots might use
    * jquery, lodash, etc.
  * `rocketboots` directory - contains the RocketBoots code
    * `core.js` - the core functionality that RocketBoots needs
    * *various components* (`.js`) - these can be pulled in individually as needed
  
You are free to structure your code however you'd like, but RocketBoots will try to use this directory structure by default.
